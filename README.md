# React Spring Mouse Parallax Landing Page

Simple landing page that uses a mouse parallax. The parallax is powered by the animation library React Spring. Check out my [documentation](https://github.com/hackersupreme/mouse-parallax-example-documentation) on how you can use the library to achieve a mouse parallax effect.

On this page the two city skylines scale at different rates creating a neat zoom effect when you move your mouse around. Imagine what good illustrators could do with this technology!
